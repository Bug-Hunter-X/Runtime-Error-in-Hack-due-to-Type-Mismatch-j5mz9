This repository contains a simple Hack program that demonstrates a common runtime error caused by a type mismatch. The program defines three functions, `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`, that perform simple arithmetic operations. However, if the input to these functions is not an integer, a runtime error will occur.  The `unsafeMain` function shows this potential error with dynamic type and it does not check for type errors and throws an error at runtime if the input is not an int. The solution shows the safe way to handle such situation.
